Final Project - Deliverable #1
02/05/2018 

1. An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it’s valuable.
An eCommerce app that allow Atlanta local homechefs to participate as vendors by selling their specialty dishes or baked goods and consumers can look up certain dishes/baked goods or vendors to purchase and place orders in advance. 

We believe that this app is valuable for food entrepreneurs who are starting out but do not currently have the means to rent a brick-and-mortar location for their business. This app will allow vendors to start expanding to consumers in Atlanta and use this as a marketing tool for their business before they move on to their next stage of owning a bakery/restaurant.
